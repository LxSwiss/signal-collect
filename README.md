Signal/Collect [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/uzh/signal-collect.png)](https://travis-ci.org/uzh/signal-collect)
========================================================================================================================

Signal/Collect is a framework for computations on large graphs. The model allows to concisely express many iterated and data-flow algorithms, while the framework parallelizes and distributes the computation.

This repository contains pre-release snapshots of the distributed 2.0 version.

How to Compile the Project
--------------------------
Ensure Java 7 is used for the compilation, verify using "java -version" on the command line.

Install SBT: http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html

Go to the project folder and start SBT on the command line. The output should end with:
"[info] Set current project to signal-collect (in build file:XYZ/signal-collect/)"

To generate a .jar file with dependencies, use the "assembly" command on the SBT prompt.

To generate an Eclipse project, use the "eclipse" command on the SBT prompt.


How to Develop in Eclipse
-------------------------
Generate an Eclipse project as described above.

Install Eclipse IDE 3.7 (Indigo) for Java developers from: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/indigosr2

Ensure that Eclipse uses the Java 7 library and JVM: Preferences → Java → Installed JREs → JRE/JDK 7 should be installed and selected.

Within Eclipse, install the Scala IDE plugins (for Scala 2.10-RC5): Help → Install New Software ... → Add → http://download.scala-ide.org/sdk/e37/scala210/dev/site/
Select and install all plugins from that location.

Open the Scala project that was generated by SBT with: File → Import... → General → Existing Projects into Workspace → select "signal-collect" folder
