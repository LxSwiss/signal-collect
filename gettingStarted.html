<h2>Prepare Eclipse IDE</h2>
<p>We suggest you install <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/indigosr2">Eclipse IDE 3.7 (Indigo)</a> for Java developers, since this is currently the officially supported version by the Scala IDE plugin.</p>
<p>For an optimal expericence please make sure that Eclipse uses the Java 7 library and JVM: Preferences → Java → Installed JREs → JRE/JDK 7 should be installed and selected.</p>
<p>To leverage Eclipse for Scala development, install the Scala IDE plugins (for Scala 2.10): Help → Install New Software ... → Add → http://download.scala-ide.org/sdk/e37/scala210/dev/site/ Select and install all plugins from that location.</p>

<h2>Download the Signal/Collect .jar file</h2>
<p>Download the Signal/Collect .jar file which is available <a href="signal-collect-2-0-0.jar">here</a></p>

<h2>Your first Signal/Collect Algorithm</h2>
<p>Now that you have all the necessary components and tools in place you are ready to implement your first algorithm based on Signal/Collect. For this purpose we selected the well known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> algorithm which calculates the relative importance of a node in a network in an iterative fashion.</p>
<p>We start off by creating a new Scala Project in an eclipse workspace. (File → New → Other... → Scala Wizards → Scala Project)</p>
<div class="span12 pagination-centered">
	<img src="images/eclipse_scala_project.png"  width="526" height="399" />
</div>
<p>Once you named your project and clicked on the <em>Finish</em> button you will see the your project folder in the package explorer on the right hand side of your IDE. The project folder already containes an empty source folder together with the Scala library and the Java Runtime Environment. In addition to these libraries we now need to add the the previously downloaded Signal/Collect jar file to the projects build path. We achieve this by right clicking on the project folder and selecting <em>Build Path → Configure Build Path ... → Libraries → Add external JARs...</em>.</p>
<p>We now have provided all the needed libraries and are ready to write for some actual coding. Since the implementation of our PageRank algorithm will be rather short, we will define all our classes in a single scala file. To add a new Scala file to your project select the <em>src</em> Folder and click on <em>New → Scala Object</em>.</p>
	
<div class="span12 pagination-centered">
	<img src="images/eclipse_scala_object.png"  width="526" height="399" />
</div>

<p>Let's name this Object <em>PageRank</em> because it will also act as the entry point of our application as we will see in just a moment.<br/>
	Our algorithm will consist of three disctinct parts which specify the structure and behavior of the vertices and edges in the graph as well as one part that handles the loading of the graph and triggers the execution.</p>
	
	<p>The definition of the vertex structure is very short since we can build on top of the default implementation that is provided by the Signal/Collect library. All that is left to do is to specify the algorithm specific collect function and the termination criterion.</p>
	
<pre class="brush: scala;">
class PageRankVertex(id: Any, dampingFactor: Double = 0.85) extends DataGraphVertex(id, 1 - dampingFactor) {

  type Signal = Double

  def collect: Double = 1 - dampingFactor + dampingFactor * signals.sum

  override def scoreSignal: Double = {
    lastSignalState match {
      case None           => 1
      case Some(oldState) => (state - oldState).abs
    }
  }
}
</pre>
	<p>Similarly we can also use the default edge implementation as a basis for our own edge and just modify its signal method.</p>
	
<pre class="brush: scala;">
class PageRankEdge(t: Any) extends DefaultEdge(t) {
  type Source = PageRankVertex
  def signal = source.state * weight / source.sumOfOutWeights
}
</pre>

<p>As a final step we now have to define the entry point for our program together with the code that sets up the graph structure and runs the algorithm.<p>

<pre class="brush: scala;">
object PageRank extends App {
  val graph = GraphBuilder.withConsole(true).build
  graph.addVertex(new PageRankVertex(1))
  graph.addVertex(new PageRankVertex(2))
  graph.addVertex(new PageRankVertex(3))
  graph.addEdge(1, new PageRankEdge(2))
  graph.addEdge(2, new PageRankEdge(1))
  graph.addEdge(2, new PageRankEdge(3))
  graph.addEdge(3, new PageRankEdge(2))

  val stats = graph.execute
  graph.awaitIdle
  println(stats)
  graph.foreachVertex(println(_))

  graph.awaitIdle
  readLine
  graph.shutdown
}
</pre>

<p>A commented version of this algorithm is also available in our <a href="https://github.com/uzh/signal-collect/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/examples/PageRank.scala">GitHub repository</a>.

	<p>Now take a deep breath and run your first PageRank algorithm on Signal/Collect.</p>

	<p> The results of this simple graph are not very interesting but they should look similar to this output:</p>
