<h2>Prepare Eclipse IDE</h2>
<p>We suggest you install <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/indigosr2">Eclipse IDE 3.7 (Indigo)</a> for Java developers, since this is currently the officially supported version by the Scala IDE plugin.</p>
<p>For an optimal expericence please make sure that Eclipse uses the Java 7 library and JVM: Preferences → Java → Installed JREs → JRE/JDK 7 should be installed and selected.</p>
<p>To leverage Eclipse for Scala development, install the Scala IDE plugins (for Scala 2.10): Help → Install New Software ... → Add → http://download.scala-ide.org/sdk/e37/scala210/dev/site/ Select and install all plugins from that location.</p>

<h2>Download the Signal/Collect .jar file</h2>
<p>Download the Signal/Collect .jar file which is available <a href="signal-collect-2-0-0.jar">here</a></p>

<h2>Your first Signal/Collect Algorithm</h2>
<p>Now that you have all the necessary components and tools in place you are ready to implement your first algorithm based on Signal/Collect. For this purpose we selected the well known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> algorithm which calculates the relative importance of a node in a network in an iterative fashion.</p>
<p>We start off by creating a new Scala Project in an eclipse workspace. (File → New → Other... → Scala Wizards → Scala Project)</p>
